# Ash & Ember PWA

This repo contains a cleaned version of the Ash & Ember game component prepared for use with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The project structure is minimal so it can be imported directly into CodeSandbox or deployed to Vercel as a progressive web app.

## Running locally

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be placed in the `dist` directory.
